**Branch Policy**

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| master | The master branch tracks released code only. The only commits to master are merges from release branches and hotfix branches. |
| release | The code in the release branch is deployed onto a suitable test environment, tested, and any problems are fixed |
| develop | As new development is completed, it gets merged back into the develop branch, which is a staging area for all completed features that havenâ€™t yet been released. So when the next release is branched off of develop, it will automatically contain all of the new features that has been finished. |
| feature | The master branch tracks released code only. The only commits to master are merges from release branches and hotfix branches. |
