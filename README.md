# Child Growth Monitor Result Generation

[Child Growth Monitor (CGM)](https://childgrowthmonitor.org) is a
game-changing app to detect malnutrition. If you have questions about the project, reach out to `info@childgrowthmonitor.org`.

## Introduction

Result Generation is performed when the Scanner App take an scan and upload using cgm-api. Result Generation plays an central role in generation of the accurate prediction of Height, Weight and MUAC for the scans collected from the scanner app. These generated results will be used by tagging tool to inspect the scans and return the results to users which are accuracte.

So when the next release is branched off of develop, it will automatically contain all of the new features that has been finished. |
| feature | The master branch tracks released code only.
